Game Play:

When the game starts, Peppermint begins to jump. When he 
lands on the platform with the correct answer, the platform turns 
green and the problem resets. If the wrong answer is chosen, 
the platform turns red and you are given another chance to bounce 
Peppermint to the right answer. It is also possible to bounce off 
the ground as many times as necessary. Keep solving problems 
to get more points!
