Scoring:

There is a score in the bottom left corner of the screen that is 
updated throughout the game. Whenever you land on a correct 
answer on the first try, the score increases by 30 points. Each 
time you guess an incorrect answer before choosing the correct 
one, the score only increases by 20 points. When you guess 
two incorrect answers before the right one, the score increases 
by 10. If you guess any more than two incorrect answers 
before the correct one, your score will not increase for that problem. 
Bouncing off the ground does not affect scoring.
