Instructions:

Welcome to PANDALGEBRA! Peppermint the Panda is lost in the bamboo forests of China! 
He is hungry and needs to answer math problems to find his favorite food: peppermint. He 
needs your help to solve the problems and fill his tummy!

Problems:
At the top of the screen, there is an algebra problem. Below the problem there are four platforms 
with possible answers. One answer is right and the other three are wrong. The goal of the game 
is to get Peppermint to jump onto the platform with the correct answer.

Game Play:
When the game starts, Peppermint begins to jump. When he lands on the platform with the 
correct answer, the platform turns green and the problem resets. If the wrong answer is chosen, 
the platform turns red and you are given another chance to bounce Peppermint to the right answer. 
It is also possible to bounce off the ground as many times as necessary. Keep solving problems 
to get more points!

Scoring:
There is a score in the bottom left corner of the screen that is updated throughout the game. 
Whenever you land on a correct answer on the first try, the score increases by 30 points. Each 
time you guess an incorrect answer before choosing the correct one, the score only increases 
by 20 points. When you guess two incorrect answers before the right one, the score increases 
by 10. If you guess any more than two incorrect answers before the correct one, your score will 
not increase for that problem. Bouncing off the ground does not affect scoring.

Now that you know how to play, are you ready to help Peppermint find food? Let's play!
